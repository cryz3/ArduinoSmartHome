Notes:

Stepper motor drives to home position:
    The motor should drive backwards until the homing switch is reached, 
    if this happens the motor should drive a few stepps forward to release the switch and stay in this position (home-position).
    
    
Stepper motor drives to view position:
    Bevore the motor starts to turn forward he has to execute a homing sequence, for a high accuracy.


In every position where the motor stays he should be dissabled.
ItÂ´s important to save the motor position and to set a software max-endstop, otherwise de machanic could be damaged by a wrong command.
